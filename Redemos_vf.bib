While internal {EU} organizations and groups claim the internal democratization of Europe, activists based outside the {EU} see it as an important external ally for the implementation of human rights and democratization (or gender equality), though they are very critical on materialistic issues, such as trade relationships.},

This paper aims to provide a systematic account for the perceptions and images of the {EU} existing in Japan's public discourses of news media, national policy- and decision-makers, the business community and civil society.

Yet, the study argues a split in perceptions of the {EU} between Japan's political and business elites on the one hand, and the general public and civil society sector on the other, with the {EU} consistently 'slipping off the radars' of the latter.},

The results of elites’ interviews conducted during September 2009–April 2010 largely verifies this in a number of interesting aspects. Especially, most of the Korean elites perceive the Korea–{EU} {FTA} as an opportunity to maximize the effects arising from “the expanded markets”, “reduced market risks” and “harmonized European business practices leading to reduced transactions costs”.

	abstract = {. In 2002, Economic Partnership Agreement ({EPA}) negotiations were initiated between the European Union ({EU}) and the Pacific Island states. As of 2009, interim {EPAs} have been initialled with two Pacific countries, while no agreements have been made with the remaining Islands. Why such meagre results? We offer an explanation to this puzzle by pinpointing fundamental incompatibilities in basic beliefs and role conceptions. Behind the superficial consensus on negotiation goals, we find incongruent understandings of what development means and of the role of {EPAs} in this context. We demonstrate the existence of incompatible role conceptions: the {EU}'s representation of itself as a generous benign partner is contrasted with the Pacific view of the {EU} as a benign master. Furthermore, the {EU} was perceived throughout the Pacific as putting undue pressure on their negotiators during the negotiations. These findings can inform the {EU}'s general role as a normative power: such power depends on shared understandings of basic ideas and values, as well as on coherence between {EU} rhetoric and practice.},

Focusing on the Mediterranean region, this article points to five paradoxes, in areas where {EU} immigration policies and actions not only fail to reach their targets but often generate opposite outcomes. This comes at high costs in terms of financial contributions and human losses. in addition, these policies unnecessarily reduce the {EU}’s negotiating power in other policy fields.

To answer this question, the article scrutinizes whether the {EU} is perceived as posing a threat to or offering an opportunity in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Theoretically it is argued that the {EU} cannot unilaterally claim a certain role in the region; rather, perceptions held by Central Asians partly determine what kind of actor the {EU} can be and what kind of policies it can successfully implement. The article finds that opportunity/threat perceptions are highly issue specific. Depending on a particular issue area, the {EU}'s image may change from that of an opportunity to a threat, or vice versa.

By doing so, the paper shifts the focus from the {EU}-centric assessment of its external activities, which has long dominated the academic literature, and provides a ‘voice’ to the targets of the {EU}’s various initiatives. Examining data obtained through the method of pictorial test and focus group discussions with students of leading Kazakhstani universities, the paper argues that the issue Brussels faces among youth is not an image problem, rather it is a visibility issue. Although Kazakhstani youth are aware of the {EU}’s main ‘attributes’ at the basic level, they have little knowledge that goes beyond stereotypical, yet positive, images of it. This stereotyped admiration towards the {EU}, however, is not necessarily an outcome of Brussels’ successful policies, rather it is partly inherited from the historically idealised image of Europe. The paper suggests that increasing its visibility and better communicating its policies and messages need to be a priority for the {EU} in Central Asia.},

The success of this approach depends, to a certain extent, on the local trust in the {EU}'s performance as a transformative actor. The present paper inquires how {EU}'s actorness is being perceived beyond its eastern borders (mainly in the border regions of Ukraine and Republic of Moldova) and explores the implications for building a more resilient society in the Eastern neighbourhood.

According to them, {EU} was frequently reported as a reference rather than a focus in Asian media, of which a majority of reports were neither positive nor negative.

We analyse how {EU} foreign assistance is understood in two different intermediary arenas of politicization – elites in different societal sectors and media – within Ukraine, a major recipient of {EU} aid. By investigating to what extent {EU} assistance is perceived to be politicized, in terms of salience and polarization we contribute to the debate on outside‐in politicization. Applying a perceptual approach to {EU} foreign policy studies, we focus on Ukrainian images of Self in its relation to the {EU} as a development actor and on Ukraine's evaluations of {EU} assistance. We consult the theory of framing and propose an operationalization of salience in terms of visibility, cultural congruence and emotive charge. We use the typology of cognitive, evaluative and affective images from political psychology to operationalize the notion of polarization.},

Understanding Chinese perceptions of the {EU} contributes to better mutual understanding and is important for further developing a positive bilateral relationship. From 2005, when the first scientific study on this topic was conducted; to 2017, over a dozen projects, many fully or partly funded by the European Commission, have been undertaken by European and Chinese scholars. This paper reviews the state of play in the research on how the Chinese media represent and how China perceives the {EU}. It compares and synthesises the studies and their findings. It argues that the studies and projects have made important scholarly contributions to academic debate and been helpful in providing policy recommendations. However, although their findings do not contradict one another, they are not consistent either. It makes the comparison to track perceptual changes difficult. A methodological reflection on perception studies is discussed, closing with recommendations for future research areas.},

We make a contribution to this field by investigating {EU} mediation effectiveness in the Russia–Ukraine conflict. The focus is on perceptions of effectiveness. Based on information from semi-structured interviews, we compare {EU} self-images with Ukrainian evaluations of {EU} mediation efforts. How effective is the {EU}, including its Member States, deemed to be? What factors are believed to lie behind perceived (in) effectiveness? We concentrate on four such factors, derived from the mediator literature: perceived (im) partiality, coherence and credibility and, finally, evaluations of the {EU}’s mediation strategies. Both internal and external views singled out {EU} member states as the most effective actors in current mediation. The role of {EU} was seen in ambivalent terms by both sides. All the four determinants of mediation effectiveness are discussed in our material, but differ considerably in the degree of attention given to each of them. While (im) partiality is not a factor that is linked to effectiveness in any straightforward way, {EU} incoherence is associated with inconsistent and weak policies, notably in the Ukraine material.},

This study compares the {EU}'s strategic partners of peace and security with narratives about the {EU} held in the {EU}'s strategic partners in Asia.

  abstract  = "ABSTRACT Despite the general narrative that the world is in a
               period of democratic decline, there have been surprisingly few
               empirical studies that assess whether this is systematically
               true. Most existing studies of global backsliding are based
               largely if not entirely on subjective indicators that rely on
               expert coder judgment. Our study surveys objective indicators of
               democracy (e.g., incumbent performance in elections) and finds
               little evidence of global democratic decline during the past
               decade. To explain the discrepancy in trends between
               expert-coded and objective indicators, we consider the role of
               coder bias and leaders strategically using more subtle
               undemocratic action. Although we cannot rule out the possibility
               that the world is becoming less democratic exclusively in ways
               that require subjective judgment to detect, this claim is not
               justified by existing evidence.",

  abstract  = "AbstractThe 1990s saw a systemic shift from the liberal
               post--World War II international order of liberal
               multilateralism (LIO I) to a post--Cold War international order
               of postnational liberalism (LIO II). LIO II has not been only
               rule-based but has openly pursued a liberal social purpose with
               a significant amount of authority beyond the nation-state. While
               postnational liberal institutions helped increase overall
               well-being globally, they were criticized for using double
               standards and institutionalizing state inequality. We argue that
               these institutional features of the postnational LIO II led to
               legitimation problems, which explain both the current wave of
               contestations and the strategies chosen by different
               contestants. We develop our argument first by mapping the
               growing liberal intrusiveness of international institutions.
               Second, we demonstrate the increased level and variety of
               contestations in international security and international
               refugee law. We show that increased liberal intrusiveness has
               led to a variety of contestation strategies, the choice of which
               is affected by the preference of a contestant regarding

               performances. Studying International Relations (IR) from the
               perspective of international practices promises three key
               advances. First, by focusing on practices in IR, we can
               understand both IR theory and international politics better or
               differently. World politics can be conceived as structured by
               practices, which give meaning to international action, make
               possible strategic interaction, and are reproduced, changed, and
               reinforced by international action and interaction. This focus
               helps broaden the ontology of world politics, serves as a focal
               point around which debates in IR theory can be structured, and
               can be used as a unit of analysis that transcends traditional
               understandings of `levels of analysis'. We illustrate what an
               international practice is by revisiting Thomas Schelling's
               seminal works on bargaining. Second, with the help of
               illustrations of deterrence and arms control during the Cold War
               and of post-Cold War practices such as cooperative security, we
               show how practices constitute strategic interaction and
               bargaining more generally. Finally, a practice perspective opens
               an exciting and innovative research agenda, which suggests new
               research questions and puzzles, and revisits central concepts of
               our discipline, including power, history, and strategy.",

  abstract  = "The words 'power' and 'influence' are unusually frequent in
               literature on international politics, but despite this, these
               terms represent an area where intensified research still seems
               necessary. Power is too often considered synonymous with
               military power, and so certain aspects of international power
               have been neglected. There is little known about how power is
               exercised by means of non-coercive methods through the exploita
               tion of a non-military power base. What, for instance, are the
               conditions that will enable a nation to negotiate successfully
               about the international monetary system in the IMF and other
               organizations? Civil power is exercised when one nation makes
               another behave in accordance with its own preferences by
               employing only the non-military components at its power base.
               Civil power is a theoretical concept which only rarely exists in
               reality.",

    abstract = {Organizational reputation theory suggests reputational threats can induce public organizations to change their behavior. However, it offers few insights into how organizations in contexts of high audience heterogeneity prioritize between conflicting threats, or how they ensure reputation-seeking signals reach their intended audiences. This article seeks to close these knowledge gaps. It expects organizational threat prioritization to be shaped by the centrality of the threat to the organization’s distinct reputation, and by differences in audiences’ capacity to put pressure on the organization through mobilization. Moreover, it argues that public organizations strategically vary the observability and costliness of outgoing reputation-seeking signals in response to shifts in the balance of reputational threats they face. It finds support for these expectations in the context of the European Commission, a supranational organization operating in a context of high audience heterogeneity and severe reputational threats. The empirical analysis is based on the Bayesian longitudinal modeling and simulation of Commission decision-making and applies a novel dataset on fiscal rule enforcement in the European Union (EU). The findings have important implications for organizational reputation theory and call for a renewed focus on the mechanisms underlying audience-induced organizational behavior.},
