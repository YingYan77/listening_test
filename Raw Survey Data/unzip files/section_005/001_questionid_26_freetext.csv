One must though keep in mind the experiences of our Eastern European neighbours with such organizations and understand their scepticism.
Any future structure or project should not be structured and talked about as an alternative -ex, an European army replacing national armies- but as its own separate instrument, tasked with pursuing different objectives and tackling different challenges."

But this may not be irrational, as research very much underpins such views. 
The message the EU should drive home is that EU membership offers huge opportunities but it is up to the (new) member states to realize this potential. It takes two to tango :)  "
