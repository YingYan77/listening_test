778,102,10,QA4,2,2024-11-27 14:55:49.473914069 +0000 UTC,1511,"Serious challenges are disinformation and divisions. Russia has made huge efforts to advance its interests through spreading disinformation and aggravate divisions in societies in the Eastern Partnership (and beyond). One of these topics is the human rights agenda and anything related to fighting discrimination (e.g. domestic violence, gender rights, LGBTQI-rights). As a result, this has negatively impacted the EU's image in most of the countries in the region (think of the referendum and presidential elections in Moldova, elections in Georgia). The EU and the pro-EU forces have not been able to debunk these hostile narratives.  

The EU should also improve its public communication on the EU assistance. The EU communication is not enough creative, engaging and this does not reach the target audiences, even if the funding for communication activities is sufficient (or at least would be sufficient if there would be good use for such funding). The EU communicators should understand that the EU is a ""product"" as any other, that needs to be effectively ""sold"" to the local audiences."
